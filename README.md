you might ask, how to use this marvelous software?

well. its as simple as:

```
python obfuscate.py [--digitnum DIGITNUM] [--namelen NAMELEN] [--strlen STRLEN] [--funccount FUNCCOUNT] num

required arguments:
	num - amount of lines

optional arguments:
	-h, --help            	show this help message and exit
	--digitnum 	DIGITNUM 	the amount of digits for the ints' values
	--namelen 	NAMELEN     length of the random generated variable names and strings
	--strlen 	STRLEN 		length of the random generated variable content (strings)
	--funccount FUNCCOUNT 	amount of functions to generate

in the future im planning to add more ep1c variables so you can customize your trash even more

planned features (when im not lazy):
- ~~choose how many functions you want to generate~~
- specify file to be written to (now it defaults to out.cpp in the directory you ran the script from)
- idk tell me what you want
