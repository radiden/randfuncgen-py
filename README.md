![](https://u.teknik.io/p09bV.png)

well now with this ep1c b1g p4s71n6 t00l you can fuck vac right in the ass

you might ask, how to use this marvelous software?

well. its as simple as:

```
python obfuscate.py [-h] num
num - amount of lines
```

for now. in the future im planning to add more ep1c variables so you can customize your trash even more

planned features (when im not lazy):
- choose how many functions you want to generate
- specify file to be written to (now it defaults to out.cpp in the directory you ran the script from)
- idk tell me what you want
